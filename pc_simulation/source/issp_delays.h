// The Delay() routine, in ISSP_Driver_Routines.c, has a delay of n+3 usec, 
// where n is the value passed to the routine.  This is true for the m8c micro-
// processor in the PSoC when it is running at a CPU clock of 24MHz and 5V.
//
// PROCESSOR_SPECIFIC
// If another processor is used, or if the m8c is running at a slower clock
// speed, then the delay parameters will be different. This file makes changing
// the delays simpiler when porting the program to other processors.

// DELAY_M is the slope of the Delay = Mx + B equation
#define DELAY_M    1
// DELAY_B is the offset of the delay in Delay = Mx + B.
#define DELAY_B    3

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// CAUTION:
// For the above parameters the minimum delay value is 3 (this would result in 
// 0 being passed for a minimum delay. A value less than 3 would actually 
// create a negative number, causing a very long delay
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// TRANSITION_TIMEOUT is a loop counter for a 100msec timeout when waiting for 
// a high-to-low transition. This is used in the polling loop of 
// fDetectHiLoTransition(). Each pass through the loop takes approximately 15
// usec. 200 msec is about 24000 loops. 24000 = ~200ms for PSoC this value MUST
// be changed depending on the host processor
// mar:  our loop only takes 3.5uSec, so the counter needs to be 5X this long
//#define TRANSITION_TIMEOUT     24000
#define TRANSITION_TIMEOUT     120000


// XRES_DELAY is the time duration for which XRES is asserted. This defines
// a 263 usec delay. Note that delay uses 8-bit values (Char).  But since
// there is a fudge factor, 258 gives us 255 ticks which results in > 263us
// The minimum Xres time (from the AN57631) is 263 usec.
#define XRES_CLK_DELAY    ((258 - DELAY_B) / DELAY_M)

// POWER_CYCLE_DELAY is the time required when power is cycled to the target
// device to create a power reset after programming has been completed. The
// actual time of this delay will vary from system to system depending on the
// bypass capacitor size.  A delay of 150 usec is used here.
#define POWER_CYCLE_DELAY ((150 - DELAY_B) / DELAY_M)

// DELAY_100us delays 100 usec. This is used in fXRESInitializeTargetForISSP to
// time the wait for Vdd to become stable after a power up.  A loop runs 10 of
// these for a total delay of 1 msec.
